While learning [@Becode](https://becode.org/), I weekly publish works (exercices, practices, memos or personal projects) that I am led to carry out in order to accomplish my journey of web apprentice.

This is one of those.

# TIM BERNERS LEE

The purpose of this project was to reproduce a one-web-page as close as possible from an original image.

This is a page about Tim Berners Lee, inventor of the web. 
The different sections are displayed in flexbox which contain a brief introduction, social icons and a short list of his favorite movies.

The one-page project is hosted on GitHubPage : [urlproject](https://jcbrognez.github.io/tim-berners-lee/)

### Basis Instructions

### Built with

* HTML
* CSS

### Challenges encountered

The biggest challenge was to get the right flex in the right place. A wrong spot and it's going all over the place ! It demands to make a little thinking about the cascading and the html structure to find out what went wrong and finally clear it all. Other than that, most of the exercice was more of a trial basis to finally get the right look.
